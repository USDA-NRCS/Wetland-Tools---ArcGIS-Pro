CW, (Converted Wetland),"A wetland converted between December 23, 1985, and November 28, 1990.",Planting of agricultural commodities or additional manipulation will cause ineligibility.,Maintenance allowed to scope and effect of original manipulation.
CW," (Wetland converted by county, drainage district, or similar entity)","Wetlands converted after December 23, 1985, by a county, drainage district, or similar entity and beyond a person's direct control, but not considered third party (TP).",Production of an agricultural commodity or forage for mechanical harvest or additional manipulation will cause ineligibility for USDA program benefits.,Maintenance allowed to original scope and effect of system before conversion.
CW+Year, (Converted Wetland),"A wetland converted after November 28, 1990. “Year” indicates the year the wetland was converted, and ineligibility begins.",USDA program participant and their affiliated persons are ineligible for benefits (regardless of whether ag commodity planting occurred) until the wetland is restored or mitigated. Planting of agricultural commodities is also prohibited.,Not applicable
CWTE, (Converted Wetland Technical Error),"An area converted after December 23, 1985, where the conversion or production of an agricultural commodity was a consequence of an incorrect NRCS determination.",May be used for production of agricultural commodities or forage provided no manipulation is done beyond what existed on the date of the CWTE determination.,May be maintained to the extent that existed on date of the CWTE determination.
FWP, (Farmed Wetland Pasture and Hayland),"Manipulated and used for pasture or hay before December 23, 1985 and in most years, is inundated for at least 7 consecutive days or saturated for 14 days during the growing season.","Area may be farmed and maintained as existed before December 23, 1985, as long as area is not abandoned (cessation for five consecutive years of management or maintenance operations related to the use of a farmed wetland).","May be maintained to the extent that existed before December 23, 1985."
FW, (Farmed Wetland),"A wetland that was manipulated and planted before December 23, 1985, but still meets inundation or saturation criteria, noted below. If the area is not a pothole, playa, or pocosin, it is inundated for at least 15 consecutive days during the growing season or 10 percent of the growing season, whichever is less, in most years. If the area is a pothole, playa, or pocosin: it is inundated for at least 7 consecutive days or saturated for at least 14 consecutive days during the growing season in most years.","Area may be farmed and maintained as existed before December 23, 1985, as long as area is not abandoned (cessation for five consecutive years of management or maintenance operations related to the use of a farmed wetland).","May be maintained to the extent that existed before December 23, 1985."
MIW, (Mitigation Exemption),"A converted wetland, farmed wetland or farmed wetland pasture of which the acreage, functions and values lost have been compensated for through an NRCS- approved mitigation plan.",As stipulated in the mitigation plan/agreement.,As stipulated in the mitigation plan/agreement.
MW, (Minimal Effect Exemption),"A converted wetland that is exempt from the wetland conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, based on an NRCS determination that the conversion has or will have a minimal effect on the wetlands in the area.","As stipulated in the minimal effect agreement, if applicable.","Only those activities stipulated in the minimal effect agreement, if applicable."
MWM, (Mitigation Site),"The site of wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation serving as mitigation for a converted wetland receiving a mitigation exemption.",As stipulated in the mitigation plan/agreement.,As stipulated in the mitigation plan/agreement.
NW, (Nonwetland),An area that does not contain a wetland.,No restrictions.,No restrictions unless manipulation would convert adjacent wetlands.
PC, (Prior Converted Cropland),"A wetland converted to cropland before December 23, 1985, and as of December 23, 1985, was capable of being cropped and did not meet farmed wetland inundation or saturation criteria.",No restrictions.,No restrictions unless manipulation would convert adjacent wetlands.
TP, (Third Party Exemption),"A wetland converted after December 23, 1985, by a third party who is not associated with the participant, and the conversion is not a result of a scheme or device.",May be used for production of agricultural commodities or forage.,Further drainage improvement will cause ineligibility.
W, (Wetland),"An area that meets the criteria for hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and wetland hydrology. Site typically has not been manipulated by altering hydrology and/or removing woody vegetation, including stumps. These areas include FW and FWP that have been abandoned.",May be farmed under natural conditions without drainage or removal of woody vegetation.,"Not applicable, as typically wetlands (W) are not manipulated. See NRCS for information if a W is used as a drainage outlet for another wetland."
WX, (Wetlands that have been manipulated),"A wetland manipulated after December 23, 1985, but the manipulation was not for the purpose of making production possible and agricultural commodity crop production was not made possible.",Would cause ineligibility if production was later made possible.,No restrictions as long as production not made possible including on an adjacent wetland.
